At NBCUniversal, I lead the redesign of flagship digital properties for Bravo and Oxygen networks, working in tandem with the broadcast and print design teams to launch a 360 brand refresh. With a strong focus on bold type and candid photography, we created a system of show headers that emphasized the storytelling that had become so critical to the reality television properties.

I proposed, designed, and prototyped a new mobile-first homepage experience to match the fullbleed, newsfeed images that were becoming standard in the Instagram era.

I worked closely with editors to adopt a cartegorized color system that matched the broadcast rebrand. With over 12 million unique visitors, and over 150 different, I developed a design tool to quickly try out different combinations of color and photography from within the browser, using JavaScript and HTML5. I simplfied the Show Schedule page to encourage fans to preview new video content.

The network was eager to expand content beyond articles and episode. In response, I proposed, designed and prototyped Bravo Stories, a vertical video slideshow clone of Snapchat / Instagram Stories that worked from within the mobile browser, bypassing the requirement for fans to download a separate app.

During the 2016 Election, I designed and developed a US Presidential-themed "campaign" for the annual Real Housewives Awards.

I lead art direction for a number of Bravo and Oxygen social media campaigns, and lead logo design and branding for multiple Bravo-adjacent consumer digital properties.
