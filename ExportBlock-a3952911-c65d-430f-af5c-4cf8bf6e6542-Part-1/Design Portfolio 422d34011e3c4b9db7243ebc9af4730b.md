*How did the team decide on the Taxonomy?*

The Bravo digital universe was constantly growing. Determing a tree structure of terms for the flagship Bravo Digital properties required looking at visitor data, and extracting very different use cases and personas (fans of Top Chef rarely wanted to engage with content related to Real Housewives of New York). 

How do help users find video content? How do surface related video content? How do we increase engagement with related and sponsored published content? 

We finally arrived at a two part architecture of "Shows" and "Publications". 

*What exercises did you do to determine the right IA?*

Once we bucketed content types into Shows and Publications, we looked at traffic to determine the most popular content. We found the majority of the users just wanted to watch Full Episodes, after that Preview clips. Far fewer came for the published content. 

The challenge was to encourage users who came for video to extend their visit by reading related content.

The homepage would combine both video and publication content. Shows would be primary subpages that highlight video, characters, and related publication content. Publications would be also be primary subpages, and would display both latest and popular content, and support seasonal special series.

*How did you determine the right navigational structure?*

We were charged with increasing traffic to the Publications and determined that would best be accomplished if each publication were displayed as a separate universe, alongside that of the main Bravo television network. However, we had to ensure Show and video content remained the most prominant.

After testing a number versions we landed on a good middle ground. The main Bravo universe was accessible by clicking the network logo, while the Publication properties were simply small text links. This list was to the top of the page, but shrunk and de-emphasized by overlaying it on a thin black banner. 

Almost all the visitors started on the homepage, a special sub navigation was created for the most popular links: Show Navigation, Full Episodes and Videos.

*How did you determine the components you would need to build for the site?*

We experimented with various image and typography treatments and saw an opportunity to reduce decorative UI patterns in favor of key art and photography. 

For example, instead of borders or background colors, we would rely on margin and padding to communicate information architecture. Instead of mutliple font sizes and colors, we used a strict set of values to communicate whether a list item or image is related to the current view.

This was a drastic change from the previous UI, and helped promote the brand refresh. The images popped and navigation was more intuitive.

We tested redesigned and developed the following components from scratch.

- Heros
- Sponsored
- Interstitials
- Placeholder
- Show and Post Titles
- Image heavy Tiles
- Highlight
- Video Player
- Ad Units

*Did you work collaboratively or as individuals?*

I directed and met daily with a team of two designers and 5 developers, and interfaced with stakeholders.
