I was the principle UI designer and developer for the Wealth Management teams within JPMorgan & Chase, leading a small team of front and backend engineers to design and develop and brand new suite of quantitative investment tools, for the bond and derivative trading portfolio managers.

Using web technologies, JavaScript and React, we were able to design and develop reusable components that users could then combine to create bespoke trading and analytic workflows.
