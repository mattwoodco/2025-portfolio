function assessSupplierRisk(supplierData, historicalEvents) {
  return predictiveModel.analyze({
    supplier: supplierData,
    geopoliticalFactors: getGeopoliticalData(),
    weatherPatterns: getWeatherData(),
    economicIndicators: getEconomicData(),
    historicalDisruptions: historicalEvents
  }).then(riskScore => ({
    overallRisk: riskScore.weighted_average,
    riskFactors: riskScore.contributing_factors,
    mitigationStrategies: generateMitigationPlan(riskScore)
  }));
}

// Real-time supply chain monitoring
function monitorSupplyChainHealth() {
  const dashboardMetrics = document.getElementById('supplyChainMetrics');
  const aiInsights = getAIInsights();

  processMLPredictions(aiInsights)
    .then(predictions => {
      updateVisualization(predictions);
      triggerAlerts(predictions.anomalies);
    });
}

// Machine learning model pipeline
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  initializeAIModels();
