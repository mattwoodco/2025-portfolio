This page showcases the power of combining Markdown with React components.

<Callout type="success">
  üéâ **Success!** You've successfully created an MDX page with custom components. This Callout component demonstrates how React components can be seamlessly integrated into Markdown content.
</Callout>

## What is MDX?

MDX is a powerful format that allows you to write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can:

- Use React components directly in your content
- Create interactive documentation
- Combine the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React
- Build rich, dynamic content experiences

### Key Features

Here are some key features of MDX:

1. **Component Integration**: Seamlessly use React components
2. **Markdown Syntax**: All standard Markdown features work
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
4. **Performance**: Optimized for production builds

## Code Examples

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greetUser(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to our MDX demo.`;
}

// Usage
const greeting = greetUser("Developer");
console.log(greeting);
```

And here's a TypeScript example:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user' | 'guest';
}

function createUser(name: string, role: User['role']): User {
  return { name, role };
}

const newUser = createUser("Alice", "admin");
```

## Project Showcase

Here's an example project card component in action:

<ProjectCard
  title="Hello World Project"
